    "This notebook provides a numerical simulation of the effect of a potential carbon tax on variables which have been identified as \n",
    "key drivers of the processes underlying the planetary boundaries (PB) framework. The model, upon which we base our analysis, is set up along the lines of a standard economic textbook model of decentralized competitive economy where firms and consumers have preferences over outcomes and each solve maximization problems by engaging in trade with each other. The sectors (or economic actors) we have included are those that we have identified as being central drivers of the processes underlying the PB's these include e.g. the production of fossil fuel, fertilizer, agriculture, timber, water and fisheries.  To study the implications of a carbon tax within this setting we have proceeded along the following lines:\n",
    "1. Characterize the problem each economic actor is trying to solve given their preferences, technology and constraints.\n",
    "2. Derive the corresponding first order conditions for each actor.\n",
    "3. From the first order conditions characterize the equilibrium allocation only in terms of the model variables (i.e. eliminate prices) \n",
    "4. Derive the comparitive statics of the effect of a carbon tax i.e. differentiate the equilibrium allocation fully with respect to the carbon tax.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting equilibrium outcome thus indirectly reveals how each variable in the model responds to a carbon tax."

    "The numerical solution is found as the solution to a system of 19 equations in 19 unknowns. This details of this equation system and how it was derived is found in the document referenced above (see equations 72-90). The solution method adopted below proceeds as follows:\n",
    "1. From the equation system (72-90) all terms containing the carbon tax $\\tau_E$ are moved to the left and all other terms to the right.\n",
    "2. We then proceeded by rewriting the system in matrix/vector form where the rows correspond to the equations and columns are variables (e.g. the first row in the matrix holds the parameters of equation (72), the second row equation (73), etc.). The system can thus be written as $\\mathbf{\\tau} = \\mathbf{A y}$ were $\\mathbf{\\tau}$ is a vector of containing the terms with the carbon tax, $\\mathbf{y}$ are 19x1 vectors of outcome variables and $\\mathbf{A}$ is a 19x19 matrix of parameters.\n",
    "3. The solution to the system is thus found by inverting the matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ and multiplying each side by this inverse i.e. $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{A^{-1} \\tau}$"
